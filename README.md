This is a project that has already been abandoned, as the Microsoft Store requires me to place a privacy policy here.

It can still be used normally.

You can tell from the name what it is for, but the emergence of MCP has resulted in my project having no prospects; MCP does a much better job than my application, so I gave up on this project.

After the last update, I will no longer maintain it - adding features that use other vendors' APIs.
